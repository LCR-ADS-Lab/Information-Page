# Learner Corpus Research and Applied Data Science Lab at the University of Oregon

- The LCR-ADS lab at the University of Oregon conducts linguistic research related to language development and assessment (primarily with second language users). We develop, test, and implement linguistic analysis methods, collect and annotate corpora, and develop and evaluate language assessment tools (primarily related to language production tasks).
